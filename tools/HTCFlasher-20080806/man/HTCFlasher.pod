HTCFlasher - Rom Update Utility (RUU) for HTC based devices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

HTCFlasher [-h] [-D device] [-F file] [-i] [-v] [-p]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTCFlasher is a tool that allows flashing ROMs on HTC based
devices (PocketPC and SmartPhones). You have put your device in
bootloader mode (tri-color screen), you usually do this by
pressing a button combination (tipically camera button + soft
reset). Once the device is in bootloader mode, connect it using
the USB Sync cable to a free USB port. The device should be
detected as '/dev/ttyUSB0' or similar, if not try loading the
ipaq kernel module.

Once the device is recognized, you can connect to the bootloader
and issue commands, flash a new ROM upgrade, or get device
information.
